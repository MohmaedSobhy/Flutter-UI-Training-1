# Inspiration UI

This project is a Flutter application developed to practice building a single UI screen. It serves as a personal project where I explore various Flutter widgets, layouts, and design principles.

## Features

## Single UI Screen

The project focuses on developing a single screen with a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.

## Widget Selection

I carefully selected various Flutter widgets to create an intuitive and interactive user interface.

## Responsive Design

The UI screen is designed to be responsive, ensuring elements adjust their positioning, size, and layout based on the available screen space.

## Media Queries

I utilized Flutter's media query capabilities to make UI adjustments based on the current device's screen size and orientation.
